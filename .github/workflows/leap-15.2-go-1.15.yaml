# Github workflow to build container

# Dockerfile: expected in top-level directory
#
# Name of image: taken from the action name given below
#       We might just as well be able to take it from
#       $GITHUB_REPOSITORY (which is org_or_user/repo_name)
#
# Image version:
#       Currently a concatenation of the version of the principal package in
#       this image, concatenated with the run number of this action.
#       (This would create issues when deleting an action and recreating
#       it, or when trying to build the same image from another repo -
#       so handle with care).
#
# Registry to push to:
#       Currently ghcr.io, but other registries could be configured
#       as well.
